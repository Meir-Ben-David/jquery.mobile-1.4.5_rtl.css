# jquery.mobile-1.4.5_rtl.css
The css of jquery.mobile-1.4.5 for right to left languages

I made an RTL version of jquery.mobile-1.4.5.css I called it jquery.mobile-1.4.5_rtl.css you can download it from here. Please note that you still might need to modify it if you want to change icons. I changed only the icon carat-r to carat-l and vise versa.
